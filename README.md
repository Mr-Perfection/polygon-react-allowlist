### Getting started
Go through the [wiki](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/develop/dapp-fauna-polygon-react/#getting-started.

To set up Mumbai testnet, I had to manually find one of the available networks from the [chainlist](https://chainlist.org/?search=mumbai&testnets=true).

I was able to set up my [test wallet address](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266).

I got my test coins from Polygon [faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).


### Requirements
1. User submits a first name, last name, and a Metamask wallet address.
2. User is greeted with a success message that contains the form submission information.
